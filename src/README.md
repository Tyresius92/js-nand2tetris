# `src/`

This directory contains the source code for the Nand2Tetris course in TypeScript! 

## What is in this directory?

### `gates/` (a.k.a "chips")

This directory contains all of my gate/chip implementations. These are the most basic elements of the computer, although they range from basic logical operators such as `And`, `Or`, and `Not`, all the way up to an Arithmetic Logic Unit. 

### index.js

This is currently just a stub file. It will _eventually_ contain a Tetris game, probably?
