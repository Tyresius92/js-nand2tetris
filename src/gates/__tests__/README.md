# __tests__

Unit tests for the parent directory.

## Remaining TODOs

I'd like to refactor the unit tests to either NOT use `it.each` or to at least break them into `it.each` groups by what they're asserting on. This will provide better documentation of what we're actually trying to test instead of just "I get this output for this input", which provides no real context.
