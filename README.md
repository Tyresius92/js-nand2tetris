# Nand2Tetris

This is my repository for the Nand2Tetris course, available [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

### What the heck is Nand2Tetris?

This course takes you from a single Nand (short for "not and") gate, and brings you to a working Tetris game. In this way, you learn how a computer works, all the way from 1s and 0s.

Since I am not using the course provided code, I've implemented a Nand gate in software [here](https://github.com/Tyresius92/nand2tetris/blob/main/js-nand2tetris/src/gates/Nand.ts).

From there, I built a [Not gate](https://github.com/Tyresius92/nand2tetris/blob/main/js-nand2tetris/src/gates/Not.ts), followed by an [And gate](https://github.com/Tyresius92/nand2tetris/blob/main/js-nand2tetris/src/gates/And.ts).

You proceed, building more and more abstractions on top of the things you've already built, until you have a working general purpose computer.

## Repo Structure

Instead of using the official course provided materials, I chose to implement all assignments in TypeScript. I chose to do this because I felt I already had a reasonable grasp on many of the fundamentals being taught, but also just because I wanted to learn TypeScript.

Each sub-directory in this repo contains an additional `README.md` file, detailing what exists there, good entry points to explore the code, and generally helping you get oriented quickly.

To ensure correctness, I have practiced Test Driven Development, only writing production code when I have a failing unit test.

## What is in this directory?

### `src/` directory

This is where the magic happens! Go check that thing out!

### `scripts/` directory

This directory contains a helper script which allows me to print out text in color (because I like to be fancy with my node scripts). I've made this a pretty standard practice across most of my repos, so nothing too special here. 

### `.babelrc`

This is my babel config. Gotta have that thing for TypeScript and the newer JS syntax niceties, like `import`. 

### `.eslintrc.json`

This is my ESLint config. Again, this is pretty standard across all my repos. I've actually built a couple of helper scripts to quickly bootstrap projects with my preferred configurations. 

- [Create React App Wrapper](https://github.com/Tyresius92/cra-wrapper)
- [Create Apollo Server](https://github.com/Tyresius92/create-apollo-server)
- Next up: Abstract out a "Node Template" from `Create Apollo Server` to generate node projects that don't require Apollo.

### .prettierrc.json 

My Prettier config. Goes hand in hand with the ESLint config

### `package.json` / `package-lock.json`

Dependencies and helpful scripts. These are also generated by the bootstrapper scripts listed above.
